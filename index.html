    <p>Greetings and Humble Salutations; I am Qwanesha Green, a 3rd year CIS major. I was born in Boynton Beach I am currently returning to school with excitement to finish my degree. I was raised in Delray beach, Fl but I lived in both cities. My parents have been very supportive throughout my life. I am considered to be a Bahamian American. From my mom's side of the family atleast. I am married with two children. I have had a passion for computers since I was a child. It feels terrific to be working with them again. I am a verbal person at times and also timid. I'm not very outspoken, but I like to ask questions, maybe even too many.
    </p><br>
    <p>My family is a big part of my identity, and we are close-knit. My parents have instilled in me the necessary tools to start my own family. I have been married since 2019, and we have two children. I have approximately 2 sisters, 1 little brother, 4 stepsisters, and 2 step-brothers. As you can see I come from a big family.All of my parents are close to me. We talk about almost everything,not to mention almost everyday. My daughters are my motivators, and my husband is my biggest supporter.</p>

    <p>Some of my other passions include dancing. Dance has been something that I have done since I was a little girl. I am curious, even at the age that I am today.I am focused and determined to meetmy goals. I am a very well-rounded woman who is passionate about things I like. I like to listen to music and watch movies. Also, I have a massive passion for word search puzzles and word games. I have been interested in these things since middle school and carry these passions today.
    Since I was younger I have been involved in many activities from playing softball to dancing. I enjoyed dancing the most so I kept doing it over the years. Middle school I was on the drill team at school and praise team at church. I can also type fastly I do consider that a skill. I am also very good with children I've volunteered at a daycare helping to tend to the children.Then once I got to high school I joined the band and that became great . Once I got to college I joined a dance org and I love them just as family. I can do multiple dances which include contemporary, Ballet, Tap, Jazz, and even hip-hop.
