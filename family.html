  <p> Family is significant. Whether it is a family born into, a created family, or the family that adopts, people try to be as close to the people that matter the most to them. I am the oldest of my siblings and my dad's only biological child. From my step-siblings, I am the youngest on my dad's side and the most senior on my mom's. I have always been with many siblings, so I'm not used to a small family. My grandfather(Mom's Dad) is full of Bahamians. He even has a great, thick accent. We have been over there quite a bit. I have a whole lot of family around in the Bahamas. My grandad is the only boy and has 12 sisters.   </p>

  <p> The first time on campus, an organization intrigued an interest, and they have always acted as a  family. We did everything together, which made homesickness less of a feeling. They also introduced us to having sisters with whom bonds have grown. We call each other like real sisters and check upon each other til this day. I got involved with the organization and later joined the NAACP. This program was very vigorous, and they both promoted community service, which I valued. Also, we had tons of fun togethere on trips and doing shows. Its amazing how many people have the same interests or in common with.  </p>
 

  
  
  
  
  
    <p>The actual family is still pretty close to this day. They are connected even with arguments and disagreements. Many people are falling ill and passing away. So the motto is to stay as close as can be. Most people don't care about how immediate the family is, but it is critical. I have alot of distant cousins and some that grew up next to us. Most of the close ones grew up in Delray Beach which is where I am originally from. Then, on my dad's side most of us that grew up in Boynton Beach are close. I see my cousins often when I do go back home. Sometimes we have dinners or we see each other at other at occassions it feels good.   </p>
