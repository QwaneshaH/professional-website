    <p> I recently started selling Mary Kay last year. I have been able to make some money off of it. I am always looking for new customers. Since starting, I have only been to a few seminars. I am starting to get the hang of it, but I have plenty of products to showcase. </p>

<p> Starting this business, I was extremely nervous at first. It was new, and I didn't know what to expect. I did it to help support a friend and then learned of their many opportunities for you. Many other companies do not offer many options, which is fantastic to be a part of.</p>

<p> The products that we offer are outstanding. I was shocked at how well the skin care routines are. I use the Timewise formula for my face. It does wonders in helping to clean your face. Another great product that I use before washing my face is our charcoal mask. It digs deep and helps to clear out those clogged pores, and you see the difference. Once I have finished with this routine, my face feels and looks so rejuvenated. It's glowing even. After using the face routine and putting on some Timewise matte formulae, I have a picture of myself. It's not a foundation, but it allows your face to breathe, and there is SPF in the foundation. The products that we carry are perfect for your skin and sunburns. </p>
